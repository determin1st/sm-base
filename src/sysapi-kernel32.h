  }}} */
  /* REMARKS {{{
  Handles returned by GetStdHandle can be used by applications
  that need to read from or write to the console.
  When a console is created, the standard input handle is a handle
  to the console's input buffer, and the standard output and
  standard error handles are handles of the console's
  active screen buffer. These handles can be used by the ReadFile
  and WriteFile functions, or by any of the console functions that
  access the console input buffer or a screen buffer
  (for example, the ReadConsoleInput, WriteConsole,
  or GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo functions).

  The standard handles of a process may be redirected
  by a call to SetStdHandle, in which case GetStdHandle returns
  the redirected handle. If the standard handles have been redirected,
  you can specify the CONIN$ value in a call to the CreateFile
  function to get a handle to a console's input buffer.
  Similarly, you can specify the CONOUT$ value to get a handle to
  a console's active screen buffer.

  The standard handles of a process on entry of the main method
  are dictated by the configuration of the /SUBSYSTEM flag passed
  to the linker when the application was built.
  Specifying /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE requests that the operating system
  fill the handles with a console session on startup,
  if the parent didn't already fill the standard handle
  table by inheritance. On the contrary, /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS
  implies that the application does not need a console and
  will likely not be making use of the standard handles.
  More information on handle inheritance can be found
  in the documentation for STARTF_USESTDHANDLES.

  Some applications operate outside the boundaries of
  their declared subsystem; for instance, a /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS
  application might check/use standard handles for logging or
  debugging purposes but operate normally with a
  graphical user interface. These applications will need to
  carefully probe the state of standard handles on startup
  and make use of AttachConsole, AllocConsole,
  and FreeConsole to add/remove a console if desired.

  Some applications may also vary their behavior on
  the type of inherited handle. Disambiguating the type
  between console, pipe, file, and others can be performed
  with GetFileType.

  Handle disposal
  It is not required to CloseHandle when done with
  the handle retrieved from GetStdHandle.
  The returned value is simply a copy of the value
  stored in the process table.
  The process itself is generally considered the owner
  of these handles and their lifetime.
  Each handle is placed in the table on creation
  depending on the inheritance and launch specifics
  of the CreateProcess call and will be freed
  when the process is destroyed.

  Manual manipulation of the lifetime of these handles
  may be desirable for an application intentionally
  trying to replace them or block other parts of
  the process from using them.
  As a HANDLE can be cached by running code,
  that code will not necessarily pick up changes made via SetStdHandle.
  Closing the handle explicitly via CloseHandle will close
  it process-wide and the next usage of any cached reference
  will encounter an error.

  Guidance for replacing a standard handle in the process table
  would be to get the existing HANDLE from the table with GetStdHandle,
  use SetStdHandle to place a new HANDLE in that is opened
  with CreateFile (or a similar function),
  then to close the retrieved handle.

  There is no validation of the values stored as handles in the process
  table by either the GetStdHandle or SetStdHandle functions.
  Validation is performed at the time of the actual read/write
  operation such as ReadFile or WriteFile.

  Attach/detach behavior
  When attaching to a new console,
  standard handles are always replaced with
  console handles unless STARTF_USESTDHANDLES
  was specified during process creation.

  If the existing value of the standard handle is NULL,
  or the existing value of the standard handle looks
  like a console pseudohandle,
  the handle is replaced with a console handle.

  When a parent uses both CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE and
  STARTF_USESTDHANDLES to create a console process,
  standard handles will not be replaced unless
  the existing value of the standard handle is NULL or
  a console pseudohandle.

  Note
  Console processes must start with the standard handles
  filled or they will be filled automatically with
  appropriate handles to a new console.
  Graphical user interface (GUI) applications can be started
  without the standard handles and
  they will not be automatically filled.

  /* REMARKS {{{
  A console consists of an input buffer and one or more
  screen buffers. The mode of a console buffer determines
  how the console behaves during input or output (I/O)
  operations. One set of flag constants is used with
  input handles, and another set is used with screen
  buffer (output) handles. Setting the output modes
  of one screen buffer does not affect the output modes
  of other screen buffers.

  The ENABLE_LINE_INPUT and ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT modes only
  affect processes that use ReadFile or ReadConsole to
  read from the console's input buffer. Similarly,
  the ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT mode primarily affects ReadFile
  and ReadConsole users, except that it also determines
  whether CTRL+C input is reported in the input buffer
  (to be read by the ReadConsoleInput function) or
  is passed to a function defined by the application.

  The ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT and ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT modes
  determine whether user interactions involving window
  resizing and mouse actions are reported in the input
  buffer or discarded. These events can be read by
  ReadConsoleInput, but they are always filtered
  by ReadFile and ReadConsole.

  The ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT and ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT
  modes only affect processes using ReadFile or ReadConsole
  and WriteFile or WriteConsole.

  To change a console's I/O modes,
  call SetConsoleMode function.

  ---
  ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT 0x0001

  ---
  ENABLE_LINE_INPUT 0x0002
  ---

  when a carriage return character is read.
  If this mode is disabled, the functions return when
  one or more characters are available.
  ---
  ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT 0x0004
  ---
  Characters read by the ReadFile or ReadConsole
  function are written to the active screen buffer
  as they are typed into the console.
  This mode can be used only if the ENABLE_LINE_INPUT
  mode is also enabled.
  ---
  ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT 0x0008
  ---
  User interactions that change the size of the console
  screen buffer are reported in the console's input buffer.
  Information about these events can be read from
  the input buffer by applications using the
  ReadConsoleInput function, but not by those
  using ReadFile or ReadConsole.
  ---
  ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT 0x0010
  ---
  If the mouse pointer is within the borders of the
  console window and the window has the keyboard focus,
  mouse events generated by mouse movement and button
  presses are placed in the input buffer.
  These events are discarded by ReadFile or ReadConsole,
  even when this mode is enabled. The ReadConsoleInput
  function can be used to read MOUSE_EVENT input records
  from the input buffer.
  ---
  ENABLE_INSERT_MODE 0x0020
  ---
  When enabled, text entered in a console window
  will be inserted at the current cursor location and
  all text following that location will not be
  overwritten. When disabled, all following text
  will be overwritten.
  ---
  ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE 0x0040
  ---
  This flag enables the user to use the mouse to select
  and edit text. To enable this mode, use
  ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE | ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS.
  To disable this mode, use ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS
  without this flag.
  ---
  ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS 0x0080
  ---
  Required to enable or disable extended flags.
  See ENABLE_INSERT_MODE and ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE.
  ---
  ENABLE_AUTO_POSITION 0x100
  ---
  Though defined in WinCon.h, this flag is otherwise undocumented.
  My initial best guess is that it is related to the
  "Let system position window" check box on the property
  sheet of a CMD.EXE window,
  though I have yet to test this theory.
  ---
  ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT 0x0200
  ---
  Setting this flag directs the Virtual Terminal
  processing engine to convert user input received
  by the console window into Console Virtual
  Terminal Sequences that can be retrieved by
  a supporting application through ReadFile or
  ReadConsole functions.
  The typical usage of this flag is intended in conjunction
  with ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING on the output
  handle to connect to an application that communicates
  exclusively via virtual terminal sequences.
  ***
  If the hConsoleHandle parameter is a screen bufferhandle,
  the mode can be one or more of the following values.
  When a screen buffer is created, both output modes
  are enabled by default.
  ---
  ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT 0x0001
  ---
  Characters written by the WriteFile or WriteConsole
  function or echoed by the ReadFile or ReadConsole
  function are parsed for ASCII control sequences,
  and the correct action is performed. Backspace, tab,
  bell, carriage return, and line feed characters
  are processed. It should be enabled when using control
  sequences or when ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING is set.
  ---
  ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT 0x0002
  ---
  When writing with WriteFile or WriteConsole or echoing
  with ReadFile or ReadConsole, the cursor moves
  to the beginning of the next row when it reaches
  the end of the current row. This causes the rows displayed
  in the console window to scroll up automatically when
  the cursor advances beyond the last row in the window.
  It also causes the contents of the console screen buffer
  to scroll up (../discarding the top row of the console
  screen buffer) when the cursor advances beyond the
  last row in the console screen buffer. If this mode
  is disabled, the last character in the row
  is overwritten with any subsequent characters.
  ---
  ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING 0x0004
  ---
  When writing with WriteFile or WriteConsole,
  characters are parsed for VT100 and similar control
  character sequences that control cursor movement,
  color/font mode, and other operations that can also
  be performed via the existing Console APIs.
  For more information, see Console Virtual Terminal Sequences.
  Ensure ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT is set when using this flag.
  ---
  DISABLE_NEWLINE_AUTO_RETURN 0x0008
  ---
  When writing with WriteFile or WriteConsole,
  this adds an additional state to end-of-line wrapping
  that can delay the cursor move and buffer scroll operations.
  Normally when ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT is set and
  text reaches the end of the line, the cursor will
  immediately move to the next line and the contents
  of the buffer will scroll up by one line.
  In contrast with this flag set, the cursor does not
  move to the next line, and the scroll operation is
  not performed. The written character will be printed
  in the final position on the line and the cursor will
  remain above this character as if
  ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT was off, but the next
  printable character will be printed as if
  ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT is on.
  No overwrite will occur. Specifically, the cursor
  quickly advances down to the following line,
  a scroll is performed if necessary, the character
  is printed, and the cursor advances one more position.
  The typical usage of this flag is intended in
  conjunction with setting ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING
  to better emulate a terminal emulator where writing
  the final character on the screen
  (../in the bottom right corner) without triggering
  an immediate scroll is the desired behavior.

  The APIs for writing character attributes including
  WriteConsoleOutput and WriteConsoleOutputAttribute
  allow the usage of flags from character attributes
  to adjust the color of the foreground and background
  of text. Additionally, a range of DBCS flags was
  specified with the COMMON_LVB prefix. Historically,
  these flags only functioned in DBCS code pages for
  Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages.
  With exception of the leading byte and trailing byte
  flags, the remaining flags describing line drawing and
  reverse video (../swap foreground and background colors)
  can be useful for other languages to emphasize
  portions of output.
  Setting this console mode flag will allow these attributes
  to be used in every code page on every language.
  It is off by default to maintain compatibility with
  known applications that have historically taken advantage
  of the console ignoring these flags on non-CJK
  machines to store bits in these fields for their
  own purposes or by accident.
  Note that using the ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING
  mode can result in LVB grid and reverse video flags
  being set while this flag is still off if the
  attached application requests underlining or inverse
  video via Console Virtual Terminal Sequences.

  /* REMARKS {{{
  A console consists of an input buffer and
  one or more screen buffers. The mode of a console buffer
  determines how the console behaves during input or
  output (I/O) operations. One set of flag constants
  is used with input handles, and another set is used
  with screen buffer (output) handles. Setting the output
  modes of one screen buffer does not affect the output
  modes of other screen buffers.

  The ENABLE_LINE_INPUT and ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT modes
  only affect processes that use ReadFile or ReadConsole
  to read from the console's input buffer. Similarly,
  the ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT mode primarily affects
  ReadFile and ReadConsole users, except that it also
  determines whether CTRL+C input is reported in the
  input buffer (to be read by the ReadConsoleInput function)
  or is passed to a function defined by the application.

  The ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT and ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT modes
  determine whether user interactions involving window
  resizing and mouse actions are reported in the input
  buffer or discarded. These events can be read by
  ReadConsoleInput, but they are always filtered by
  ReadFile and ReadConsole.

  The ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT and ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT
  modes only affect processes using ReadFile or ReadConsole
  and WriteFile or WriteConsole.

  To determine the current mode of a console input buffer
  or a screen buffer, use the GetConsoleMode function.

  A code page maps 256 character codes to individual characters.
  Different code pages include different special

  If the current font is a fixed-pitch Unicode font,
  SetConsoleOutputCP changes the mapping of the
  character values into the glyph set of the font,
  rather than loading a separate font each time it
  is called. This affects how extended characters
  (ASCII value greater than 127) are displayed in
  a console window. However, if the current font
  is a raster font, SetConsoleOutputCP does not
  affect how extended characters are displayed.

  When CreateFile opens an existing file,
  it generally combines the file flags with
  the file attributes of the existing file,
  and ignores any file attributes supplied as part
  of dwFlagsAndAttributes. Special cases are detailed
  in Creating and Opening Files.
  ---
  Some of the following file attributes and flags
  may only apply to files and not necessarily all
  other types of devices that CreateFile can open.
  For additional information, see the Remarks section
  of this topic and Creating and Opening Files.
  For more advanced access to file attributes,
  see SetFileAttributes. For a complete list of
  all file attributes with their values and descriptions,
  see File Attribute Constants.

  Attribute/Meaning
  ---
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE 32 (0x20)
  ---
  The file should be archived. Applications use this
  attribute to mark files for backup or removal.
  ---
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ENCRYPTED 16384 (0x4000)
  ---
  The file or directory is encrypted. For a file,
  this means that all data in the file is encrypted.
  For a directory, this means that encryption is
  the default for newly created files and subdirectories.
  For more information, see File Encryption.
  This flag has no effect if FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM
  is also specified.
  This flag is not supported on Home, Home Premium,
  Starter, or ARM editions of Windows.
  ---
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN 2 (0x2)
  ---
  The file is hidden. Do not include it in an
  ordinary directory listing.
  ---
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL 128 (0x80)
  ---
  The file does not have other attributes set.
  This attribute is valid only if used alone.
  ---
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_OFFLINE 4096 (0x1000)
  ---
  The data of a file is not immediately available.
  This attribute indicates that file data is physically
  moved to offline storage. This attribute is used by
  Remote Storage, the hierarchical storage management
  software. Applications should not arbitrarily
  change this attribute.
  ---
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY 1 (0x1)
  ---
  The file is read only. Applications can read the file,
  but cannot write to or delete it.
  ---
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM 4 (0x4)
  ---
  The file is part of or used exclusively
  by an operating system.
  ---
  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY 256 (0x100)
  ---
  The file is being used for temporary storage.
  For more information, see the Caching Behavior
  section of this topic.

  Flag/Meaning
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS 0x02000000
  ---
  The file is being opened or created for a backup or
  restore operation. The system ensures that
  the calling process overrides file security
  checks when the process has SE_BACKUP_NAME and
  SE_RESTORE_NAME privileges. For more information,
  see Changing Privileges in a Token.
  You must set this flag to obtain a handle
  to a directory. A directory handle can be passed
  to some functions instead of a file handle.
  For more information, see the Remarks section.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE 0x04000000
  ---
  The file is to be deleted immediately after all of
  its handles are closed, which includes the specified
  handle and any other open or duplicated handles.
  If there are existing open handles to a file,
  the call fails unless they were all opened with
  the FILE_SHARE_DELETE share mode.
  Subsequent open requests for the file fail,
  unless the FILE_SHARE_DELETE share mode is specified.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING 0x20000000
  ---
  The file or device is being opened with no system
  caching for data reads and writes. This flag does not
  affect hard disk caching or memory mapped files.
  There are strict requirements for successfully working
  with files opened with CreateFile using the
  FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING flag, for details see File Buffering.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_OPEN_NO_RECALL 0x00100000
  ---
  The file data is requested, but it should continue
  to be located in remote storage. It should not be
  transported back to local storage. This flag is
  for use by remote storage systems.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT 0x00200000
  ---
  Normal reparse point processing will not occur;
  CreateFile will attempt to open the reparse point.
  When a file is opened, a file handle is returned,
  whether or not the filter that controls the reparse
  point is operational.
  This flag cannot be used with the CREATE_ALWAYS flag.
  If the file is not a reparse point,
  then this flag is ignored.
  For more information, see the Remarks section.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED 0x40000000
  ---
  The file or device is being opened or
  created for asynchronous I/O.
  When subsequent I/O operations are
  completed on this handle, the event specified in
  the OVERLAPPED structure will be set to the signaled state.
  If this flag is specified, the file can be used
  for simultaneous read and write operations.
  If this flag is not specified, then I/O operations
  are serialized, even if the calls to the read and
  write functions specify an OVERLAPPED structure.
  For information about considerations when using
  a file handle created with this flag,
  see the Synchronous and Asynchronous I/O Handles
  section of this topic.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_POSIX_SEMANTICS 0x01000000
  ---
  Access will occur according to POSIX rules.
  This includes allowing multiple files with names,
  differing only in case, for file systems
  that support that naming. Use care when using this option,
  because files created with this flag may not
  be accessible by applications that are written for
  MS-DOS or 16-bit Windows.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS 0x10000000
  ---
  Access is intended to be random. The system can use
  this as a hint to optimize file caching.
  This flag has no effect if the file system does not
  support cached I/O and FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING.
  For more information, see the Caching Behavior
  section of this topic.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_SESSION_AWARE 0x00800000
  ---
  The file or device is being opened with session
  awareness. If this flag is not specified,
  then per-session devices (such as a device using
  RemoteFX USB Redirection) cannot be opened by
  processes running in session 0. This flag has
  no effect for callers not in session 0.
  This flag is supported only on server editions of Windows.
  Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008:
  This flag is not supported before Windows Server 2012.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN 0x08000000
  ---
  Access is intended to be sequential from beginning to end.
  The system can use this as a hint to optimize file caching.
  This flag should not be used if read-behind
  (that is, reverse scans) will be used.
  This flag has no effect if the file system does not
  support cached I/O and FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING.
  For more information, see the Caching Behavior section
  of this topic.
  ---
  FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH 0x80000000
  ---
  Write operations will not go through any
  intermediate cache, they will go directly to disk.
  For additional information, see the Caching Behavior
  section of this topic.

  The dwFlagsAndAttributes parameter can also specify
  SQOS information. For more information,
  see Impersonation Levels. When the calling application
  specifies the SECURITY_SQOS_PRESENT flag as part of
  dwFlagsAndAttributes, it can also contain one or
  more of the following values.

  Security flag / Meaning
  ---
  SECURITY_ANONYMOUS
  Impersonates a client at the Anonymous impersonation level.
  ---
  SECURITY_CONTEXT_TRACKING
  The security tracking mode is dynamic.
  If this flag is not specified,
  the security tracking mode is static.
  ---
  SECURITY_DELEGATION
  Impersonates a client at the Delegation impersonation level.
  ---
  SECURITY_EFFECTIVE_ONLY
  Only the enabled aspects of the client's security
  context are available to the server. If you do not
  specify this flag, all aspects of the client's
  security context are available.
  This allows the client to limit the groups and privileges
  that a server can use while impersonating the client.
  ---
  SECURITY_IDENTIFICATION
  Impersonates a client at the Identification
  impersonation level.
  ---
  SECURITY_IMPERSONATION
  Impersonate a client at the impersonation level.
  This is the default behavior if no other flags are
  specified along with the SECURITY_SQOS_PRESENT flag.

  HANDLE /* [in, optional] hTemplateFile {{{
  A valid handle to a template file with the
  GENERIC_READ access right. The template file supplies
  file attributes and extended attributes for
  the file that is being created.
  This parameter can be NULL.
  When opening an existing file,
  CreateFile ignores this parameter.
  When opening a new encrypted file,
  the file inherits the discretionary access control list

  }}} */
  /* REMARKS {{{
  CreateFile was originally developed specifically
  for file interaction but has since been expanded and
  enhanced to include most other types of I/O devices
  and mechanisms available to Windows developers.
  This section attempts to cover the varied issues
  developers may experience when using CreateFile
  in different contexts and with different I/O types.
  The text attempts to use the word file only
  when referring specifically to data stored in
  an actual file on a file system. However,
  some uses of file may be referring more generally
  to an I/O object that supports file-like mechanisms.
  This liberal use of the term file is particularly
  prevalent in constant names and parameter names
  because of the previously mentioned historical reasons.
  When an application is finished using the
  object handle returned by CreateFile,
  use the CloseHandle function to close the handle.
  This not only frees up system resources,
  but can have wider influence on things like
  sharing the file or device and committing
  data to disk. Specifics are noted within this
  topic as appropriate.
  Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:
  A sharing violation occurs if an attempt is
  made to open a file or directory for deletion on
  a remote computer when the value of the dwDesiredAccess
  parameter is the DELETE access flag (0x00010000)
  OR'ed with any other access flag, and the remote file or
  directory has not been opened with FILE_SHARE_DELETE.
  To avoid the sharing violation in this scenario,
  open the remote file or directory with the DELETE
  access right only, or call DeleteFile without
  first opening the file or directory for deletion.
  Some file systems, such as the NTFS file system,
  support compression or encryption for individual
  files and directories. On volumes that have a mounted
  file system with this support, a new file inherits
  the compression and encryption attributes of its directory.
  You cannot use CreateFile to control compression,
  decompression, or decryption on a file or directory.
  For more information, see Creating and Opening Files,
  File Compression and Decompression, and File Encryption.
  Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:
  For backward compatibility purposes, CreateFile does not
  apply inheritance rules when you specify a security
  descriptor in lpSecurityAttributes. To support inheritance,
  functions that later query the security descriptor
  of this file may heuristically determine and
  report that inheritance is in effect. For more information,
  see Automatic Propagation of Inheritable ACEs.
  As stated previously, if the lpSecurityAttributes
  parameter is NULL, the handle returned by CreateFile
  cannot be inherited by any child processes your
  application may create. The following information
  regarding this parameter also applies:
  If the bInheritHandle member variable is not FALSE,
  which is any nonzero value, then the handle
  can be inherited. Therefore it is critical this
  structure member be properly initialized to FALSE
  if you do not intend the handle to be inheritable.
  The access control lists (ACL) in the default
  security descriptor for a file or directory are inherited
  from its parent directory.
  The target file system must support security
  on files and directories for the lpSecurityDescriptor
  member to have an effect on them,
  which can be determined by using GetVolumeInformation.

  OVERLAPPED*, /* [in, out] lpOverlapped {{{
  A pointer to an OVERLAPPED data structure
  that supplies data to be used during
  the overlapped (asynchronous) write operation.
  For files that support byte offsets,
  you must specify a byte offset at which to start
  writing to the file. You specify this offset
  by setting the Offset and OffsetHigh members
  of the OVERLAPPED structure. For files or devices
  that do not support byte offsets,
  Offset and OffsetHigh are ignored.
  To write to the end of file, specify both
  the Offset and OffsetHigh members of the
  OVERLAPPED structure as 0xFFFFFFFF.
  This is functionally equivalent to
  previously calling the CreateFile function
  to open hFile using FILE_APPEND_DATA access.
  The WriteFileEx function ignores the OVERLAPPED
  structure's hEvent member.
  An application is free to use that member
  for its own purposes in the context of a
  WriteFileEx call. WriteFileEx signals completion
  of its writing operation by calling,
  or queuing a call to, the completion routine
  pointed to by lpCompletionRoutine,
  so it does not need an event handle.
  The WriteFileEx function does use
  the Internal and InternalHigh members of the
  OVERLAPPED structure. You should not change
  the value of these members.
  The OVERLAPPED data structure must remain valid
  for the duration of the write operation.
  It should not be a variable that can go out of scope

  The return value for an asynchronous operation

  successfully or if the operation completed

  operation was completed successfully,
  check that dwErrorCode is 0, call
  GetOverlappedResult, then call GetLastError.
  For example, if the buffer was not large
  enough to receive all of the data from a call
  to ReadFileEx, dwErrorCode is set to 0,
  GetOverlappedResult fails, and GetLastError
  returns ERROR_MORE_DATA.

  }}} */
  /* REMARKS {{{
  When using WriteFileEx you should check GetLastError
  even when the function returns "success"
  to check for conditions that are successes but
  have some outcome you might want to know about.
  For example, a buffer overflow when calling
  WriteFileEx will return TRUE,
  but GetLastError will report the overflow
  with ERROR_MORE_DATA.
  If the function call is successful and
  there are no warning conditions,
  GetLastError will return ERROR_SUCCESS.
  The WriteFileEx function will fail if the hFile
  parameter is associated with an I/O completion port.
  To perform writes using this type of handle,
  use the WriteFile function.
  The WriteFileEx function may fail if there are
  too many outstanding asynchronous I/O requests.
  In the event of such a failure,
  GetLastError can return ERROR_INVALID_USER_BUFFER
  or ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY.
  To cancel all pending asynchronous I/O
  operations, use either:

  * CancelIo: This function only cancels operations
  issued by the calling thread for the
  specified file handle.
  * CancelIoEx: This function cancels all operations
  issued by the threads for the
  specified file handle.

  Use CancelSynchronousIo to cancel pending
  synchronous I/O operations.
  I/O operations that are canceled complete
  with the error ERROR_OPERATION_ABORTED.

  If part of the file specified by hFile
  is locked by another process,
  and the specified write operation overlaps
  the locked portion, WriteFileEx fails.
  When writing to a file, the last write time
  is not fully updated until all handles used
  for writing have been closed.
  Therefore, to ensure an accurate last write time,
  close the file handle immediately
  after writing to the file.
  Accessing the output buffer while a write operation
  is using the buffer may lead to corruption
  of the data written from that buffer.
  Applications must not write to, reallocate,
  or free the output buffer that a write operation
  is using until the write operation completes.
  Note that the time stamps may not
  be updated correctly for a remote file.
  To ensure consistent results, use unbuffered I/O.
  The system interprets zero bytes to write
  as specifying a null write operation and
  WriteFile does not truncate or extend the file.
  To truncate or extend a file, use
  the SetEndOfFile function.
  An application uses the WaitForSingleObjectEx,
  WaitForMultipleObjectsEx, MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx,
  SignalObjectAndWait, and SleepEx functions
  to enter an alertable wait state.
  For more information about alertable wait states and
  overlapped I/O operations, see About Synchronization.
  If you write directly to a volume that has
  a mounted file system, you must first obtain
  exclusive access to the volume.
  Otherwise, you risk causing data corruption or
  system instability, because your application's
  writes may conflict with other changes coming
  from the file system and leave the contents of
  the volume in an inconsistent state.
  To prevent these problems,
  the following changes have been made in
  Windows Vista and later:

  A write on a volume handle will succeed
  if the volume does not have a mounted file system,
  or if one of the following conditions is true:

  - The sectors to be written to are boot sectors.
  - The sectors to be written to reside outside
  of file system space.
  - You have explicitly locked or dismounted
  the volume by using FSCTL_LOCK_VOLUME or
  FSCTL_DISMOUNT_VOLUME.
  - The volume has no actual file system.
  In other words, it has a RAW file system mounted.

  A write on a disk handle will succeed
  if one of the following conditions is true:

  - The sectors to be written to do not
  fall within a volume's extents.
  - The sectors to be written to fall within
  a mounted volume, but you have explicitly locked
  or dismounted the volume by using
  FSCTL_LOCK_VOLUME or FSCTL_DISMOUNT_VOLUME.
  - The sectors to be written to fall within
  a volume that has no mounted file system
  other than RAW.

  There are strict requirements for successfully
  working with files opened with CreateFile
  using FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING.

  ---
  The documentation for the functions that create
  these objects indicates that CloseHandle should
  be used when you are finished with the object,
  and what happens to pending operations on the object
  after the handle is closed.
  In general, CloseHandle invalidates the specified
  object handle, decrements the object's handle count,
  and performs object retention checks.
  After the last handle to an object is closed,
  the object is removed from the system.
  For a summary of the creator functions
  for these objects, see Kernel Objects.
  Generally, an application should call CloseHandle once
  for each handle it opens. It is usually not necessary
  to call CloseHandle if a function that
  uses a handle fails with ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE,
  because this error usually indicates
  that the handle is already invalidated.
  However, some functions use ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
  to indicate that the object itself is no longer valid.
  For example, a function that attempts to use a handle
  to a file on a network might fail with
  ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE if the network connection
  is severed, because the file object
  is no longer available.
  In this case, the application should close the handle.

  If a handle is transacted, all handles bound
  to a transaction should be closed before the transaction
  is committed. If a transacted handle was opened by
  calling CreateFileTransacted with the FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE
  flag, the file is not deleted until the application
  closes the handle and calls CommitTransaction.
  For more information about transacted objects,
  see Working With Transactions.

  Closing a thread handle does not terminate the
  associated thread or remove the thread object.
  Closing a process handle does not terminate the
  associated process or remove the process object.
  To remove a thread object, you must terminate the thread,
  then close all handles to the thread.
  For more information, see Terminating a Thread.
  To remove a process object, you must terminate
  the process, then close all handles to the process.
  For more information, see Terminating a Process.

  Closing a handle to a file mapping can succeed
  even when there are file views that are still open.
  For more information, see Closing a File Mapping Object.

  Do not use the CloseHandle function to close a socket.
  Instead, use the closesocket function,
  which releases all resources associated with
  the socket including the handle to the socket object.
  For more information, see Socket Closure.

  Do not use the CloseHandle function to close a handle
  to an open registry key.
  Instead, use the RegCloseKey function.
  CloseHandle does not close the handle
  to the registry key, but does not return an error
  to indicate this failure.

  The return value is the calling thread's last-error code.
  The Return Value section of the documentation
  for each function that sets the last-error
  code notes the conditions under which
  the function sets the last-error code.
  Most functions that set the thread's last-error
  code set it when they fail. However,
  some functions also set the last-error code
  when they succeed. If the function is not documented
  to set the last-error code, the value returned
  by this function is simply the most recent
  last-error code to have been set;
  some functions set the last-error code to 0
  on success and others do not.
  Remarks
  Functions executed by the calling thread
  set this value by calling the SetLastError function.
  You should call the GetLastError function immediately
  when a function's return value indicates
  that such a call will return useful data.
  That is because some functions call SetLastError
  with a zero when they succeed,
  wiping out the error code set by
  the most recently failed function.

  To obtain an error string for system error codes,
  use the FormatMessage function.
  For a complete list of error codes provided
  by the operating system, see System Error Codes.

  The error codes returned by a function are not
  part of the Windows API specification and
  can vary by operating system or device driver.
  For this reason, we cannot provide the complete
  list of error codes that can be returned
  by each function. There are also many functions
  whose documentation does not include even
  a partial list of error codes that can be returned.

  Error codes are 32-bit values
  (bit 31 is the most significant bit).
  Bit 29 is reserved for application-defined error codes;
  no system error code has this bit set.
  If you are defining an error code for your application,
  set this bit to one.
  That indicates that the error code has been defined
  by an application, and ensures that your error code
  does not conflict with any error codes
  defined by the system.

  To convert a system error into an HRESULT value,
  use the HRESULT_FROM_WIN32 macro.

  This parameter can be one or more of the following values.
  ---
  FORMAT_MESSAGE_ALLOCATE_BUFFER 0x00000100
  ---
  The function allocates a buffer large enough to hold the
  formatted message, and places a pointer to the allocated
  buffer at the address specified by lpBuffer.
  The lpBuffer parameter is a pointer to an LPTSTR;
  you must cast the pointer to an LPTSTR (for example,
  (LPTSTR)&lpBuffer). The nSize parameter specifies the
  minimum number of TCHARs to allocate for an output
  message buffer. The caller should use the LocalFree
  function to free the buffer when it is no longer needed.
  If the length of the formatted message exceeds 128K bytes,
  then FormatMessage will fail and a subsequent call to
  GetLastError will return ERROR_MORE_DATA.

  ----
  The lpSource parameter is a pointer to a null-terminated

  The message definition may contain insert sequences,
  just as the message text in a message table resource may.
  This flag cannot be used with FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_HMODULE
  or FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM.
  ---
  FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM 0x00001000
  ---
  The function should search the system message-table
  resource(s) for the requested message. If this flag is
  specified with FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_HMODULE, the function
  searches the system message table if the message is not
  found in the module specified by lpSource.
  This flag cannot be used with FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING.

  are to be ignored and passed through to the output buffer
  unchanged. This flag is useful for fetching a message
  for later formatting. If this flag is set, the Arguments
  parameter is ignored.

  The low-order byte of dwFlags can specify the maximum width
  of a formatted output line. The following are possible
  values of the low-order byte.
  ---
  0
  ---
  There are no output line width restrictions.
  The function stores line breaks that are in the message
  definition text into the output buffer.
  ---
  FORMAT_MESSAGE_MAX_WIDTH_MASK 0x000000FF
  ---
  The function ignores regular line breaks in the message
  definition text. The function stores hard-coded line
  breaks in the message definition text into the output
  buffer. The function generates no new line breaks.

  If the low-order byte is a nonzero value other than
  FORMAT_MESSAGE_MAX_WIDTH_MASK, it specifies the maximum
  number of characters in an output line. The function
  ignores regular line breaks in the message definition text.
  The function never splits a string delimited by white space

  the wrong type. In particular, it is unsafe to take an
  arbitrary system error code returned from an API and
  use FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM without
  FORMAT_MESSAGE_IGNORE_INSERTS.

  The function performs more quickly when none of

  WC_NO_BEST_FIT_CHARS and WC_COMPOSITECHECK with
  the specific value WC_DEFAULTCHAR to retrieve all
  possible conversion results. If all three values are
  not provided, some results will be missing.
  ---
  WC_COMPOSITECHECK
  ---
  Convert composite characters, consisting of a base
  character and a nonspacing character, each with
  different character values. Translate these
  characters to precomposed characters, which have a
  single character value for a base-nonspacing character
  combination. For example, in the character Ã¨, the e
  is the base character and the accent grave mark is
  the nonspacing character.
  Windows normally represents Unicode strings with
  precomposed data, making the use of the
  WC_COMPOSITECHECK flag unnecessary.
  Your application can combine WC_COMPOSITECHECK
  with any one of the following flags, with the
  default being WC_SEPCHARS. These flags determine
  the behavior of the function when no precomposed
  mapping for a base-nonspacing character combination
  in a Unicode string is available. If none of these
  flags is supplied, the function behaves as if the
  WC_SEPCHARS flag is set. For more information,

  Fail (by returning 0 and setting the last-error
  code to ERROR_NO_UNICODE_TRANSLATION) if an invalid
  input character is encountered. You can retrieve
  the last-error code with a call to GetLastError.
  If this flag is not set, the function replaces
  illegal sequences with U+FFFD (encoded as
  appropriate for the specified codepage) and
  succeeds by returning the length of the
  converted string. Note that this flag only
  applies when CodePage is specified as CP_UTF8 or
  54936. It cannot be used with other code
  page values.
  ---
  WC_NO_BEST_FIT_CHARS
  ---
  Translate any Unicode characters that do not
  translate directly to multibyte equivalents to
  the default character specified by lpDefaultChar.
  In other words, if translating from Unicode to
  multibyte and back to Unicode again does not
  yield the same Unicode character, the function
  uses the default character. This flag can be
  used by itself or in combination with the other
  defined flags.
  For strings that require validation, such as file,
  resource, and user names, the application should
  always use the WC_NO_BEST_FIT_CHARS flag.
  This flag prevents the function from mapping
  characters to characters that appear similar but
  have very different semantics. In some cases,
  the semantic change can be extreme. For example,
  the symbol for "â" (infinity) maps to 8 (eight)

  this function writes the number of characters
  specified by cbMultiByte to the buffer indicated

  cchWideChar, the function writes no characters
  to lpMultiByteStr.
  The WideCharToMultiByte function operates most

  ===
  lpDefaultChar/lpUsedDefaultChar/Result
  ---

  ===
  Starting with Windows Vista, this function fully
  conforms with the Unicode 4.1 specification for UTF-8 and
  UTF-16. The function used on earlier operating systems
  encodes or decodes lone surrogate halves or mismatched
  surrogate pairs. Code written in earlier versions of
  Windows that rely on this behavior to encode random
  non-text binary data might run into problems.
  However, code that uses this function to produce valid
  UTF-8 strings will behave the same way as on earlier
  Windows operating systems.

  Starting with Windows 8: WideCharToMultiByte is declared
  in Stringapiset.h. Before Windows 8, it was declared
  in Winnls.h.

  WC_COMPOSITECHECK and related flags
  ---
  As discussed in Using Unicode Normalization to Represent Strings,
  Unicode allows multiple representations of the same
  string (interpreted linguistically). For example,
  Capital A with dieresis (umlaut) can be represented either
  precomposed as a single Unicode code point "Ã" (U+00C4)
  or decomposed as the combination of Capital A and the
  combining dieresis character ("A" + "Â¨", that is U+0041 U+0308).
  However, most code pages provide only composed characters.
  The WC_COMPOSITECHECK flag causes the WideCharToMultiByte
  function to test for decomposed Unicode characters and
  attempts to compose them before converting them to
  the requested code page. This flag is only available
  for conversion to single byte (SBCS) or double byte
  (DBCS) code pages (code pages < 50000, excluding code page 42).
  If your application needs to convert decomposed Unicode
  data to single byte or double byte code pages,
  this flag might be useful. However, not all characters
  can be converted this way and it is more reliable to
  save and store such data as Unicode.

  When an application is using WC_COMPOSITECHECK,
  some character combinations might remain incomplete or
  might have additional nonspacing characters left over.
  For example, A + Â¨ + Â¨ combines to Ã + Â¨.
  Using the WC_DISCARDNS flag causes the function to
  discard additional nonspacing characters.
  Using the WC_DEFAULTCHAR flag causes the function to
  use the default replacement character (typically "?") instead.
  Using the WC_SEPCHARS flag causes the function to
  attempt to convert each additional
  nonspacing character to the target code page.

  The access to the process object. This access right
  is checked against the security descriptor for the process.
  This parameter can be one or more
  of the process access rights.
  If the caller has enabled the SeDebugPrivilege privilege,
  the requested access is granted regardless
  of the contents of the security descriptor.
  ---
  The Microsoft Windows security model enables
  you to control access to process objects.
  When a user logs in, the system collects
  a set of data that uniquely identifies the user
  during the authentication process,
  and stores it in an access token.
  This access token describes the security
  context of all processes associated with
  the user. The security context of a process
  is the set of credentials given to the process
  or the user account that created the process.
  You can use a token to specify the current
  security context for a process using the
  CreateProcessWithTokenW function.
  You can specify a security descriptor for
  a process when you call the CreateProcess,
  CreateProcessAsUser, or CreateProcessWithLogonW function.
  If you specify NULL, the process gets a default
  security descriptor. The ACLs in the default
  security descriptor for a process come
  from the primary or impersonation token of
  the creator.To retrieve a processâs security
  descriptor, call the GetSecurityInfo function.
  To change a processâs security descriptor,
  call the SetSecurityInfo function.
  The valid access rights for process objects
  include the standard access rights and some
  process-specific access rights.

  The GetExitCodeProcess function returns
  a valid error code defined by the application

  The file Psapi.dll is installed in the %windir%\System32

  on your computer, it can lead to the following error
  when running applications on your system:
  "The procedure entry point GetProcessImageFileName
  could not be located in the dynamic link library
  PSAPI.DLL." To work around this problem,
  locate any versions that are not in the
  %windir%\System32 directory and delete or
  rename them, then restart.
  The GetProcessImageFileName function returns
  the path in device form, rather than drive letters.
  For example, the file name
  C:\Windows\System32\Ctype.nls would look as
  follows in device form:
  \Device\Harddisk0\Partition1\Windows\System32\Ctype.nls
  ---
  To retrieve the module name of the current process,
  use the GetModuleFileName function with a NULL
  module handle. This is more efficient than calling
  the GetProcessImageFileName function with a handle
  to the current process.
  To retrieve the name of the main executable module
  for a remote process in win32 path format,
  use the QueryFullProcessImageName function.
  Starting with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2,
  Psapi.h establishes version numbers for the PSAPI
  functions. The PSAPI version number affects
  the name used to call the function and the library
  that a program must load.
  If PSAPI_VERSION is 2 or greater, this function
  is defined as K32GetProcessImageFileName in Psapi.h
  and exported in Kernel32.lib and Kernel32.dll.
  If PSAPI_VERSION is 1, this function is defined
  as GetProcessImageFileName in Psapi.h and exported
  in Psapi.lib and Psapi.dll as a wrapper that calls
  K32GetProcessImageFileName.
  Programs that must run on earlier versions of Windows
  as well as Windows 7 and later versions should
  always call this function as GetProcessImageFileName.
  To ensure correct resolution of symbols,
  add Psapi.lib to the TARGETLIBS macro and compile
  the program with -DPSAPI_VERSION=1.
  To use run-time dynamic linking, load Psapi.dll.

  /* REMARKS {{{
  This function causes a thread to relinquish
  the remainder of its time slice and become unrunnable
  for an interval based on the value of dwMilliseconds.
  After the sleep interval has passed,
  the thread is ready to run. Note that a ready thread
  is not guaranteed to run immediately.
  Consequently, the thread will not run until
  some arbitrary time after the sleep interval elapses,
  based upon the system "tick" frequency and
  the load factor from other processes.
  The system clock "ticks" at a constant rate.
  To increase the accuracy of the sleep interval,
  call the timeGetDevCaps function to determine
  the supported minimum timer resolution and
  the timeBeginPeriod function to set the timer
  resolution to its minimum.
  Use caution when calling timeBeginPeriod,
  as frequent calls can significantly affect
  the system clock, system power usage, and the scheduler.
  If you call timeBeginPeriod, call it one time early
  in the application and be sure to call
  the timeEndPeriod function at the very end
  of the application. If you specify 0 milliseconds,
  the thread will relinquish the remainder of its
  time slice but remain ready. For more information,
  see Scheduling Priorities.

  This function can be used with the ReadFileEx or
  WriteFileEx functions to suspend a thread until
  an I/O operation has been completed.
  These functions specify a completion routine that is
  to be executed when the I/O operation has been completed.
  For the completion routine to be executed,
  the thread that called the I/O function must be
  in an alertable wait state when
  the completion callback function occurs.
  A thread goes into an alertable wait state
  by calling either SleepEx, MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx,
  WaitForSingleObjectEx, or WaitForMultipleObjectsEx,
  with the function's bAlertable parameter set to TRUE.
  ---
  Be careful when using SleepEx in the following scenarios:
  - Code that directly or indirectly creates windows
  (for example, DDE and COM CoInitialize).
  If a thread creates any windows, it must process messages.
  Message broadcasts are sent to all windows in the system.
  If you have a thread that uses SleepEx with infinite delay,
  the system will deadlock.
  - Threads that are under concurrency control.
  For example, an I/O completion port or thread pool limits
  the number of associated threads that can run.
  If the maximum number of threads is already running,
  no additional associated thread can run until
  a running thread finishes. If a thread uses SleepEx
  with an interval of zero to wait for one of the
  additional associated threads to accomplish some work,
  the process might deadlock.
  ---
  For these scenarios, use MsgWaitForMultipleObjects or
  MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx, rather than SleepEx.
